/**
 * Dart empowers `class` to create compile-time constant objects.
 * 
 * If a class has `final` fields, these fields are initialized at runtime but later can not be modified.
 * When multiple objects are created from this class by passing the same arguments to the constructor,
 * a new instance of the class is created every single time.
 * 
 * We can create a constant constructor by placing `const` keyword before it.
 * Using constant constructors, a compile-time constant object is created by placing
 * `const` keyword before the class instatiation syntax.
 * 
 * Using the same principle, we are able create create compile-time constant List, Set and Map.
 * 
 * 🔥 Use:
 * 1. Const constructors creates canonicalized instances.
 * __ Which means class instantiation with the same arguments will reuse old instance.
